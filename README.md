# Spotify and Genius Data Analysis Project

This project involves collecting and analyzing data from both Spotify and Genius to gain insights into music genres and lyrics. It consists of four main scripts:

1. `spotify_data_collection.py`: Collects data on top tracks from various music genres using the Spotify API.

2. `results_spotify.py`: Analyzes and visualizes data collected from Spotify, focusing on artist counts and generating word clouds for top artists in each genre.

3. `genius_lyrics_data_collection.py`: Collects lyrics data for songs using the Genius API and combines it with Spotify data.

4. `results_genius.py`: Analyzes and visualizes lyrics data, generating word clouds and bar charts to represent the most frequent words in lyrics for different music genres.
